# Challenge 1: Lightsabar Color or Colorful Box Changer
()
Create an interactive Colorful Box Changer application using React!

The goal of this challenge is to build a user interface with the following functionality:

- Display a box on the screen.
- Provide an input box where users can enter a color name or hex code.
- When the user enters a valid color name or hex code, the box's background color should change to the specified color.
- Display the color name and hex code in the center of the box.
- Your task is to implement this functionality using React components and state management.

Here are some guidelines to get you started:

Use React's state to manage the color value entered by the user.
Handle user input and update the state accordingly.
Use CSS or inline styles to style the box and center the text inside it.
Validate the user's input to ensure it is a valid color name or hex code.
Feel free to get creative with the design and additional features if you'd like!

Once you complete the challenge, share your solution with the React Jedi community and celebrate your success!

May the React Force be with you on this colorful coding adventure! ðŸŒˆðŸ’»
